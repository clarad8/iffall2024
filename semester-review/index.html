                A website describing a recipe for creating fluffy banana pancakes. This recipe is super simple
                and comes together in just a few minutes. You don’t need any fancy ingredients or gadgets.
                These pancakes freeze well, so they’re perfect for meal prep. Make a batch on the weekend and enjoy them
                all week long!

            <h2>Microsite - Creative Director</h2>
            <p>
                This Graffiti microsite is developed by Gioia Wang as the designer, and I was the creative director,
                giving the initial ideas and design suggestions along the way. The website is designed to showcase
                iconic graffiti art across New York City, exploring the history and evolution of graffiti culture from
                its rise
                to its decline and the forces that have shaped it over time.

            <h2>Microsite - Designer</h2>
            <p>
                This microsite about Louis Kahn is developed by me with Anaeld Ramos as the creative director.
                This website presents a biography of Louis Kahn in a visual style that pays homage to his architectural
                designs.
                I was tasked with designing this website with a mainly charcoal gray themed background and hints of red
                and yellow throughout the pages.
