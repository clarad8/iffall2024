            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>

                <li>Serve with banana slices and maple syrup.</li>

            <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
            <h3> <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes">America's Taste Kitchen</a></h3>
            <p>I like how professional and straightforward the design is, reflecting the brand’s focus on reliable
                recipes. It avoids excessive embellishments that can distract from the content. Additionally, I
                appreciate the light red background, which creates a cozy atmosphere that's perfect for home cooking
                recipes.</p>

            <h3> <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a></h3>
            <p>The website features a clean and modern design with a focus on high-quality images, which enhances the
                appeal of the recipes. The use of whitespace helps to avoid clutter, allowing users to focus on content.
                The search bar is also well designed in which it allows the users to quickly look up specific recipes or
                occasions people can cook for.</p>

            <h3> <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/category/recipes/">Spend with Pennies</a></h3>
            <p>I like how the design is warm and inviting, using a friendly color palette and appealing images that
                resonate with home cooks. Also the inclusion of user reviews and photos encourages community interaction
                and provides social proof of the recipes' success.
            </p>

            <h2>Non-recipe Websites</h2>
            <h3> <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a></h3>
            <p>I love how this website focuses on content and readability with a minimalist design that emphasizes white
                space. The platform’s use of large fonts and a clean layout helps me focus on the articles without
                distraction. For my recipe website, I can consider prioritizing clear, readable fonts and ample white
                space.</p>

            <h3> <a href="https://www.ericnam.com/">Eric Nam</a></h3>
            <p>My favorite is the homepage featuring a large, striking image of the artist, instantly grabbing my
                attention. I think this technique can be applied to my recipe website by using high-quality images of
                finished dishes or vibrant ingredients to draw users in.
            </p>

            <h3> <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a></h3>
            <p>I like the stunning visuals and an intuitive layout to create an engaging user experience. The use of
                high-quality images immediately captures attention, making the content feel inviting. Additionally, the
                website's clean and simple navigation allows users to explore easily without feeling overwhelmed. These
                are all helpful techniques that I should consider when designing my websites.</p>
