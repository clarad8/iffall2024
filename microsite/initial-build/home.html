                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Louis Isadore Kahn (February 20 1901 – March 17, 1974) was an Estonian-born American architect
                        based
                        in Philadelphia. After working in various capacities for several firms in Philadelphia, he
                        founded
                        his own atelier in 1935. While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and
                        professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his
                        death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the University of
                        Pennsylvania.

                    <h2>Early Career</h2>
                    <p>As a child in Kuressaare on Saaremaa Island (then part of the Russian Empire), he suffered burns
                        that
                        left lifelong scars after a stove accident. His family emigrated to the U.S. in 1906, fearing
                        his
                        father would be drafted in the Russo-Japanese War. Facing poverty, the family made homemade
                        charcoal
                        for Louis to use in drawing, and he later earned money playing piano for silent films. He became
                        a
                        U.S. citizen in 1914, and in 1915, his father changed their surname to Kahn.</p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>Kahn excelled in art from a young age, repeatedly winning the annual award for the best
                        watercolor by
                        a Philadelphia high school student. He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at
                        Philadelphia Central High School until he took a course in architecture in his senior year,
                        which
                        convinced him to become an architect. He turned down an offer to go to the Pennsylvania Academy
                        of
                        the Fine Arts to study art under a full scholarship, instead working at a variety of jobs to pay
                        his
                        own tuition for a degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts.
                        There, he studied under Paul Philippe Cret in a version of the Beaux-Arts tradition, one that
                        discouraged excessive ornamentation.

                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>Louis Kahn began his architecture career in 1924, working on Philadelphia’s 1926 Sesquicentennial
                        Exposition and later studying medieval European structures on a 1928 tour. Upon returning to the
                        U.S., he worked with architects Paul Cret and Zantzinger, Borie, and Medary, and co-founded the
                        Architectural Research Group, focusing on socially conscious public housing projects that were
                        largely unbuilt.

                        Kahn found his unique architectural style in the 1950s after an influential stay in Rome,
                        inspired by ancient ruins. His style embraced modernism’s principles but avoided strict dogma.
                        He
                        proposed urban planning ideas for Philadelphia, like a viaduct system for traffic, though these
                        were
                        unexecuted. Kahn also held prominent teaching roles at Yale, MIT, and the University of
                        Pennsylvania, where he influenced a generation of architects.
