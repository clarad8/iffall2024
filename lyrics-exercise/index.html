        <p>Drank too much, got the sickness
            Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
            Same crew but another mistress
            Every day, every night getting wasted
            But I miss you, what did I do?
            it up, laugh it off, and I lost you
            If I pull through, is it too soon?
            Turn it up, close my eyes, then I'm with you
        </p>

        <p>Yo Marvin, stop callin'
            Sad Iverson is ballin'
            In the corner of a room by himself
            You are nothin' but an empty shell
            Every night, he going down to hell
            Fake love in a shit hotel
            Can't believe how far he fell
            You weak on the floor so you call her cell</p>

        <p>"How you been?", "How you doing?"
            You been good, I been drinking
            Way too much, you think that I'd be over you, over you, over you
            (Eight calls, all you)
            But I think about it every day, yeah
            Yeah, I never missed her anyways
            Yeah, I never missed her anyways
        </p>


        <p>Drank too much, got the sickness

        <p>Call me up
            Stay over and we'll call it love
            Don't matter if it me up
            The alcohol is not enough</p>
        <p> pride and the other guy
            I cried, I don't 'member why
            Tonight, I'ma try to hide
            No slide, get frostbite
            Eight calls, all you, eight-ball, all you
            Yeah, I never missed her anyways
            Yeah, I never missed her anyways</p>
